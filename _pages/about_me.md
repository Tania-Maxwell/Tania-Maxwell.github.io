<img align="right" src="/img/pic_scotora_website_mini.png"> I am a Research Scholar in the [Biodiversity, Ecology, and Conservation](https://iiasa.ac.at/programs/bnr/bec) group of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria, working on the [RESIST](https://iiasa.ac.at/projects/resist) project with [Florian Hofhansl](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/florian-hofhansl). I recently finished a postdoc in the [Global Coastal Wetlands](https://www.globalcoastalwetlands.com/) team of the [Conservation Science Group](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/conservation-science-group-members) at the Department of Zoology of the University of Cambridge. I am currently also finalizing our project working on a global model and map of soil carbon in tidal marshes.

My professional interests include \[forest, soil, coastal...\] ecology, biogeochemistry, global changes, spatial modelling, R, data analysis and reproducible coding. For my PhD thesis, I investigated the interactive effects of tree diversity and water availability on nutrient cycling in forests at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment ([INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en/centers/nouvelle-aquitaine-bordeaux)), under the supervision of [Laurent Augusto](https://www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/ispa_eng/Research/ISPA-teams/BIONUT-Group/BIONUT-Group/AUGUSTO-Laurent) and [Nicolas Fanin](https://www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/ispa_eng/Research/ISPA-teams/BIONUT-Group/BIONUT-Group/FANIN-Nicolas) at INRAE, and [Alison Munson](https://www.cef-cfr.ca/index.php?n=Membres.AlisonMunson) at the Université Laval. We worked on two unique sites within the Tree Diversity Network which manipulate both tree diversity and water availability: [ORPHEE](https://sites.google.com/view/orpheeexperiment/home) in Southwestern France (left/top) and [IDENT](http://www.treedivnet.ugent.be/ExpIDENT.html) in Sault-Ste.-Marie, Ontario, Canada (right/bottom).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Integrative Biology at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://ib.berkeley.edu/) (go bears!). After graduating, I spent four adventurous months living in a tent in Yosemite National Park, working as a field assistant for a chipmunk behavioral study, which was followed by a few months of solo traveling, working as a waitress and then as a summer camp director. Afterwards I completed a Master's in Biodiversity, Ecology, and Evolution at the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/formation/master/biodiversity-ecology-evolution). During the first year of my graduate studies, I worked on a project studying nutrient fluxes within the soil-microorganism-tree system with [Laure Barthes](https://www.ese.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/team-members/laure-barthes/) at the [Laboratoire Ecologie Systématique Evolution](https://www.ese.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/homepage/). My Master's thesis during my second year focused on the effect of global changes on organic nitrogen cycling, with [Wolfgang Wanek](https://ter.csb.univie.ac.at/people/wolfgang-wanek) of the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research](https://ter.csb.univie.ac.at/) team at the University of Vienna.

Aside from working and learning, I enjoy other nature activities (hiking, camping and backpacking), playing Touch Rugby, and commuting by bike. One of my proudest achievements was completing the John Muir Trail (California Sierra Mountains) in 2018 with a good friend, a 210 mi/370km three-week backpacking trip ending with a sunrise summit of Mt. Whitney.
