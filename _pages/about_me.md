I am a 2nd year PhD student at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE), in a double-degree program focused on Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems at the [Université de Bordeaux](https://ed-environnements.u-bordeaux.fr/), and Forest Sciences at the [Université Laval](https://www.sbf.ulaval.ca/doctorat-en-sciences-forestieres) in Québec, Canada. <img align="right" src="/img/pic_scotora_website_mini.png"> 
<br>
My professional interests include soil ecology, biogeochemistry, diversity, global changes, R and coding. For my PhD project, I am investigating the interactive effects of tree diversity and water availability on nutrient cycling in forests. To do so, we are working on two unique sites within the Tree Diversity Network which manipulate both tree diversity and water availability: [ORPHEE](https://sites.google.com/view/orpheeexperiment/home) in Southwestern France (left) and [IDENT](http://www.treedivnet.ugent.be/ExpIDENT.html) in Sault-Ste.-Marie, Ontario, Canada (right).

I did my Bachelor's degree in Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley (go bears!). After graduating, I spent four adventurous months living in a tent in Yosemite National Park, working as a field assistant for a chipmunk behavioral study, which was followed by a few months of solo traveling, working as a waitress and then as a summer camp director. I then complete a Master's in Biodiversity, Ecology, Evolution at the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/formation/master/biodiversity-ecology-evolution). During the first year of my graduate studies, I worked on a project studying nutrient fluxes within the soil-microorganism-tree system with [Laure Barthes](https://www.ese.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/team-members/laure-barthes/) at the [Laboratoire Ecologie Systématique Evolution](https://www.ese.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/homepage/). My Master's thesis focused on the effect of global changes on organic nitrogen cycling, with [Wolfgang Wanek](https://ter.csb.univie.ac.at/people/wolfgang-wanek) of the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research](https://ter.csb.univie.ac.at/) team at the University of Vienna.

Aside from working and learning, I enjoy other nature activities (hiking, camping and backpacking), playing various sports (volleyball, soccer, rugby), and commuting by bike. One of my most proud achievements was completing the John Muir Trail in the Californian Sierra Mountains with a good friend, a 210 mi/370km three-week backpacking trip ending with summiting Mt. Whitney.
