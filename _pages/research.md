### PhD Project

Forests are major terrestrial ecosystems that provide a multitude of ecosystem functions and services, such as biomass production, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. In this project, I aim to determine whether tree biodiversity may offset the negative effects of drought on nutrient cycling in forests. To answer this research question, two common garden sites belonging to the worldwide Tree Diversity Network (TreeDivNet) will be studied : [ORPHEE](https://sites.google.com/view/orpheeexperiment/home) in Southwestern France and [IDENT](http://www.treedivnet.ugent.be/ExpIDENT.html) in Sault-Ste.-Marie, Ontario, Canada. Both of these experimental sites manipulate tree diversity (species richness and functional diversity), and water resource (irrigation, with additional rain exclusion in Canada).

In the first section of the project, we aim to determine whether tree biodiversity improves **nutrient availability** in soils. To do so, we will study potential spatial complementarity of the interactive effect between biodiversity x irrigation on available nutrients and extracellular enzyme activities along the soil profile. Then, we will look into potential temporal complementarity of belowground organic and inorganic nitrogen processes on soil nutrient availability in our system. The second section aims to study the biodiversity x irrigation interactive effects on **nutrient uptake**, by using a <sup>15</sup>N labelled soil solution at different points throughout the vegetation season. The third and final section will determine if the trees in the mixed plots can more efficiently use the nutrients that have been taken up. To do so, litterfall will be collected regularly, and two metrics of efficiency will be calculated (namely, **Nutrient Use Efficiency** and Nutrient Resorption Efficiency).

### MSc. Thesis (Project II)

For my Master's thesis, I spent six months with the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research](https://ter.csb.univie.ac.at/) team at the University of Vienna, supervised by [Wolfgang Wanek](https://ter.csb.univie.ac.at/people/wolfgang-wanek). During this time, I investigated the effect of the global changes on gross organic nitrogen processes. To do so, soil samples were collected from a global change facility in a managed montane grassland in Austria that had been simulating elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature for four years, with an additional drought and rewetting treatment. I measured gross protein depolymerization and amino acid utilization rates using a novel high throughoutput isotope pool dilution approach ([Noll et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.12.005)). I am continuing to collaborated with Prof. Wanek and have planned a two-month stay in the TER lab in 2021, to measure gross organic nitrogen rates in the context of my PhD project.

### Master Project I

For my first year Master's project, we simultaneously quantified the fate of a soil applied <sup>15</sup>N solution incorportated into different tree compartments (fine roots, medium roots, xylem, phloem, branches, leaves), extractable soil, and the microbial biomass at several time points before and after budburst in mature oak trees. During this project, I helped with sample preparation (grinding + microcapsule weighing) and data analyses. Check out our paper from the study coming soon!

### Summer with the chipmunks

My first taste of research was the one and only [Tali Hammond](https://tthammond.weebly.com/). With an awesome field team, I spent four months running after chipmunks in the Sierra Mountains, California. We used accelerometers to measure behavorial activity budgets between two co-occupring chipmunk species, the alpine chipmunk (_Tamias alpinus_) and the lodgepole chipmunk (_T. speciosus_), and how these budgets relate to biological factors, climate and species co-occurance. We also studied how the flea communities differed between these two species, leading up to a plague epizootic. Check out some cool results [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2019.04.011).
